2. **Coding Style**: Adhere to [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.
    - Use a linter such as `phpcs` for automatic standard checking:
      ```bash
      composer phpcs
      ```

      ```bash
      composer phpcbf
      ```
3. **Naming Conventions**:
    - Use meaningful variable, method, and class names.
    - Consistent camelCase for variable names and PascalCase for class names.
4. **Type Hints**: Use strict types (`declare(strict_types=1);`) and type hints for all functions and methods.
5. **Comments and Documentation**:
    - Provide clear, concise comments where needed.
    - Use PHPDoc for documenting classes, methods, and significant code sections.
